Florence is an 84-year-old lady with hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis. She
lives at home on her own, and has weekly visits from her daughter who lives
35 miles away. She also receives daily support from a care worker to help with
activities of daily living.
She is currently prescribed:
 bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg daily
 lisinopril 10 mg daily
 simvastatin 40 mg at night
 methotrexate 20 mg once weekly on a Wednesday
 folic acid 5 mg daily except on Wednesday
 paracetamol 1 g four times daily when needed.
On Friday evening, an on-call GP visits Florence because she has been feeling
unwell with symptoms of urinary frequency, dysuria and urge incontinence for a
few days. The GP diagnoses a urinary tract infection (UTI) and prescribes
trimethoprim 200 mg twice daily for 3 days. On Sunday, the care worker is very
concerned that Florence has deteriorated and is nauseous and confused. She
calls an ambulance and Florence is admitted to hospital.
A hospital doctor changes the trimethoprim to co-amoxiclav because her UTI
symptoms have not improved. After a few days Florence is feeling much better,
her UTI symptoms resolve and she is discharged from hospital. The practice
pharmacist checks the discharge summary and identifies a drug interaction with
the trimethoprim and methotrexate.
